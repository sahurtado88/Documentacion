# AZURE

Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals. Azure services range from simple web services for hosting your business presence in the cloud to running fully virtualized computers for you to run your custom software solutions. Azure provides a wealth of cloud-based services like remote storage, database hosting, and centralized account management. Azure also offers new capabilities like AI and Internet of Things (IoT).
 

## AZURE SERVICES 

### Compute

People are able to access more information than ever before. Personal digital assistants led to smartphones, and now there are smart watches, smart thermostats, and even smart refrigerators. Personal computers used to be the norm. Now the internet allows any item that's online-capable to access valuable information. This ability for devices to garner and then relay information for data analysis is referred to as IoT.

Many services can assist and drive end-to-end solutions for IoT on Azure.

| IoT Edge | Fully managed service that allows data analysis models to be pushed directly onto IoT devices, which allows them to react quickly to state changes without needing to consult cloud-based AI models. |

### Big data 

Data comes in all formats and sizes. When we talk about big data, we're referring to large volumes of data. Data from weather systems, communications systems, genomic research, imaging platforms, and many other scenarios generate hundreds of gigabytes of data. This amount of data makes it hard to analyze and make decisions. It's often so large that traditional forms of processing and analysis are no longer appropriate.

Open-source cluster technologies have been developed to deal with these large data sets. Azure supports a broad range of technologies and services to provide big data and analytic solutions.

Service name

| Azure Databricks | Integrate this collaborative Apache Spark-based analytics service with other big data services in Azure. |

### AI

AI, in the context of cloud computing, is based around a broad range of services, the core of which is machine learning. Machine learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. Using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed.

Forecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter. For example, when you shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products you might like based on what you've purchased. Or when your credit card is swiped, machine learning compares the transaction to a database of transactions and helps detect fraud. And when your robot vacuum cleaner vacuums a room, machine learning helps it decide whether the job is done.

| Service name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Azure Machine Learning Service | Cloud-based environment you can use to develop, train, test, deploy, manage, and track machine learning models. It can auto-generate a model and auto-tune it for you. It will let you start training on your local machine, and then scale out to the cloud. |
| Azure ML Studio | Collaborative visual workspace where you can build, test, and deploy machine learning solutions by using prebuilt machine learning algorithms and data-handling modules. |

A closely related set of products are the cognitive services. You can use these prebuilt APIs in your applications to solve complex problems.

| Service name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Vision | Use image-processing algorithms to smartly identify, caption, index, and moderate your pictures and videos. |

### DevOps

DevOps brings together people, processes, and technology by automating software delivery to provide continuous value to your users. With Azure DevOps, you can create build and release pipelines that provide continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for your applications. You can integrate repositories and application tests, perform application monitoring, and work with build artifacts. You can also work with and backlog items for tracking, automate infrastructure deployment, and integrate a range of third-party tools and services such as Jenkins and Chef. All of these functions and many more are closely integrated with Azure to allow for consistent, repeatable deployments for your applications to provide streamlined build and release processes.

| Service name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Azure DevOps | Use development collaboration tools such as high-performance pipelines, free private Git repositories, configurable Kanban boards, and extensive automated and cloud-based load testing. Formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services. |
| Azure DevTest Labs | Quickly create on-demand Windows and Linux environments to test or demo applications directly from deployment pipelines. |

## Get started with Azure accounts

When you're working with your own applications and business needs, you need to create an Azure account, and a subscription will be created for you. After you've created an Azure account, you're free to create additional subscriptions. For example, your company might use a single Azure account for your business and separate subscriptions for development, marketing, and sales departments. After you've created an Azure subscription, you can start creating Azure resources within each subscription.

Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned.
Organizations pay only for what they use.
- **Private cloud**
Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance.
Organizations have complete control over resources and security.
Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates.
- **Hybrid cloud**
Provides the most flexibility.
Organizations determine where to run their applications.
Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements.

## What are some cloud computing advantages?
There are several advantages that a cloud environment has over a physical environment that Tailwind Traders can use following its migration to Azure.

High availability: Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.

Scalability: Apps in the cloud can scale vertically and horizontally:

Scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration.
Elasticity: You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need.

Agility: Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.

Geo-distribution: You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region.

Disaster recovery: By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.

### Capital expenses vs. operating expenses
There are two different types of expenses that you should consider:

- Capital Expenditure (CapEx) is the up-front spending of money on physical infrastructure, and then deducting that up-front expense over time. The up-front cost from CapEx has a value that reduces over time.
- Operational Expenditure (OpEx) is spending money on services or products now, and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense in the same year you spend it. There is no up-front cost, as you pay for a service or product as you use it.

## Cloud service model comparison


|IaaS|PaaS|SaaS
|-|-|-|
|The most flexible cloud service.|Focus on application development.|Pay-as-you-go pricing model.|
|You configure and manage the hardware for your application.|Platform management is handled by the cloud provider.|Users pay for the software they use on a subscription model.|

The following chart illustrates the various levels of responsibility between a cloud provider and a cloud tenant.

![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/fundamental-azure-concepts/media/shared-responsibility-76efbc1e.png)

## What is serverless computing?
Like PaaS, serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure. With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.

## Overview of Azure subscriptions, management groups, and resources

![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/media/scope-levels-12669ee1.png)

- **Resources**: Resources are instances of services that you create, like virtual machines, storage, or SQL databases.
- **Resource groups**: Resources are combined into resource groups, which act as a logical container into which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed.
- **Subscriptions**: A subscription groups together user accounts and the resources that have been created by those user accounts. For each subscription, there are limits or quotas on the amount of resources that you can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, or projects.
- **Management groups**: These groups help you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.

## Azure regions, availability zones, and region pairs

### Azure Region 
A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network.

**Special Azure regions**
Azure has specialized regions that you might want to use when you build out your applications for compliance or legal purposes. A few examples include:

- US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more: These regions are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for U.S. government agencies and partners. These datacenters are operated by screened U.S. personnel and include additional compliance certifications.
- China East, China North, and more:These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft doesn't directly maintain the datacenters.

### availability zone
Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.


![alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/azure-architecture-fundamentals/media/availability-zones-5c3c490c.png)

### Azure region pair
Each Azure region is always paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away. This approach allows for the replication of resources (such as VM storage) across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions because of events such as natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages that affect both regions at once. If a region in a pair was affected by a natural disaster, for instance, services would automatically failover to the other region in its region pair.

## Azure resource groups
Resource groups are a fundamental element of the Azure platform. A resource group is a logical container for resources deployed on Azure. These resources are anything you create in an Azure subscription like VMs, Azure Application Gateway instances, and Azure Cosmos DB instances. All resources must be in a resource group, and a resource can only be a member of a single resource group. Many resources can be moved between resource groups with some services having specific limitations or requirements to move. Resource groups can't be nested. Before any resource can be provisioned, you need a resource group for it to be placed in.

## Azure Resource Manager
Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You use management features like access control, locks, and tags to secure and organize your resources after deployment.

When a user sends a request from any of the Azure tools, APIs, or SDKs, Resource Manager receives the request. It authenticates and authorizes the request. Resource Manager sends the request to the Azure service, which takes the requested action. Because all requests are handled through the same API, you see consistent results and capabilities in all the different tools.

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/azure-architecture-fundamentals/media/consistent-management-layer-feef9259.png)

### The benefits of using Resource Manager

With Resource Manager, you can:

Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts. A Resource Manager template is a JSON file that defines what you want to deploy to Azure.
Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.
Redeploy your solution throughout the development life cycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state.
Define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order.
Apply access control to all services because RBAC is natively integrated into the management platform.
Apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.
Clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources that share the same tag.



## Azure subscriptions

Using Azure requires an Azure subscription. A subscription provides you with authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services.

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/azure-architecture-fundamentals/media/subscriptions-afe063a7.png)

An account can have one subscription or multiple subscriptions that have different billing models and to which you apply different access-management policies. You can use Azure subscriptions to define boundaries around Azure products, services, and resources. There are two types of subscription boundaries that you can use:

Billing boundary: This subscription type determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure. You can create multiple subscriptions for different types of billing requirements. Azure generates separate billing reports and invoices for each subscription so that you can organize and manage costs.
Access control boundary: Azure applies access-management policies at the subscription level, and you can create separate subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures. An example is that within a business, you have different departments to which you apply distinct Azure subscription policies. This billing model allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision with specific subscriptions.

You might want to create additional subscriptions for resource or billing management purposes. For example, you might choose to create additional subscriptions to separate:

Environments: When managing your resources, you can choose to create subscriptions to set up separate environments for development and testing, security, or to isolate data for compliance reasons. This design is particularly useful because resource access control occurs at the subscription level.
Organizational structures: You can create subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures. For example, you could limit a team to lower-cost resources, while allowing the IT department a full range. This design allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision within each subscription.
Billing: You might want to also create additional subscriptions for billing purposes. Because costs are first aggregated at the subscription level, you might want to create subscriptions to manage and track costs based on your needs. For instance, you might want to create one subscription for your production workloads and another subscription for your development and testing workloads.
You might also need additional subscriptions because of:

Subscription limits: Subscriptions are bound to some hard limitations. For example, the maximum number of Azure ExpressRoute circuits per subscription is 10. Those limits should be considered as you create subscriptions on your account. If there's a need to go over those limits in particular scenarios, you might need additional subscriptions.

Customize billing to meet your needs
If you have multiple subscriptions, you can organize them into invoice sections. Each invoice section is a line item on the invoice that shows the charges incurred that month. For example, you might need a single invoice for your organization but want to organize charges by department, team, or project.

Depending on your needs, you can set up multiple invoices within the same billing account. To do this, create additional billing profiles. Each billing profile has its own monthly invoice and payment method.

The following diagram shows an overview of how billing is structured. If you've previously signed up for Azure or if your organization has an Enterprise Agreement, your billing might be set up differently.

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/azure-architecture-fundamentals/media/billing-structure-overview-2c81a8ad.png)

Azure management groups
If your organization has many subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions. You organize subscriptions into containers called management groups and apply your governance conditions to the management groups. All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group. Management groups give you enterprise-grade management at a large scale no matter what type of subscriptions you might have. All subscriptions within a single management group must trust the same Azure AD tenant.

For example, you can apply policies to a management group that limits the regions available for VM creation. This policy would be applied to all management groups, subscriptions, and resources under that management group by only allowing VMs to be created in that region.

Hierarchy of management groups and subscriptions
You can build a flexible structure of management groups and subscriptions to organize your resources into a hierarchy for unified policy and access management. The following diagram shows an example of creating a hierarchy for governance by using management groups.

Diagram showing an example of a management group hierarchy tree.

You can create a hierarchy that applies a policy. For example, you could limit VM locations to the US West Region in a group called Production. This policy will inherit onto all the Enterprise Agreement subscriptions that are descendants of that management group and will apply to all VMs under those subscriptions. This security policy can't be altered by the resource or subscription owner, which allows for improved governance.

Another scenario where you would use management groups is to provide user access to multiple subscriptions. By moving multiple subscriptions under that management group, you can create one role-based access control (RBAC) assignment on the management group, which will inherit that access to all the subscriptions. One assignment on the management group can enable users to have access to everything they need instead of scripting RBAC over different subscriptions.

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/azure-architecture-fundamentals/media/management-groups-and-subscriptions-bba71896.png)

Important facts about management groups
10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.
A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level.
Each management group and subscription can support only one parent.
Each management group can have many children.
All subscriptions and management groups are within a single hierarchy in each directory.

## Serverless Compute

Azure has two implementations of serverless compute:

Azure Functions: Functions can execute code in almost any modern language.
Azure Logic Apps: Logic apps are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered by Azure services without writing any code.

### Functions vs. Logic Apps
Functions and Logic Apps can both create complex orchestrations. An orchestration is a collection of functions or steps that are executed to accomplish a complex task.

With Functions, you write code to complete each step.
With Logic Apps, you use a GUI to define the actions and how they relate to one another.
You can mix and match services when you build an orchestration, calling functions from logic apps and calling logic apps from functions. Here are some common differences between the two.

||Functions|Logic Apps|
|-|-|-|
|State|Normally stateless, but Durable Functions provide state.| Stateful|
|Development|Code-first (imperative).|Designer-first (declarative).|
|Connectivity|About a dozen built-in binding types. Write code for custom bindings.|Large collection of connectors. Enterprise Integration Pack for B2B scenarios. Build custom connectors|
|Actions|Each activity is an Azure function. Write code for activity functions.|Large collection of ready-made actions.|
|Monitoring|Azure Application Insights.|Azure portal, Log Analytics.|
|Management|REST API, Visual Studio.|Azure portal, REST API, PowerShell, Visual Studio.|
|Execution context|Can run locally or in the cloud.|Runs only in the cloud.|

## Azure Virtual Desktop

Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud. It enables your users to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location. Azure Virtual Desktop works across devices like Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and Linux. It works with apps that you can use to access remote desktops and apps. You can also use most modern browsers to access Azure Virtual Desktop-hosted experiences.

## Azure virtual networking

Azure virtual networks enable Azure resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to communicate with each other, with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers. You can think of an Azure network as an extension of your on-premises network with resources that links other Azure resources.

Azure virtual networks provide the following key networking capabilities:

- Isolation and segmentation
- Internet communications
- Communicate between Azure resources
- Communicate with on-premises resources
- Route network traffic
- Filter network traffic
- Connect virtual networks

### Communicate between Azure resources
You'll want to enable Azure resources to communicate securely with each other. You can do that in one of two ways:

- Virtual networks Virtual networks can connect not only VMs but other Azure resources, such as the App Service Environment for Power Apps, Azure Kubernetes Service, and Azure virtual machine scale sets.
- Service endpoints You can use service endpoints to connect to other Azure resource types, such as Azure SQL databases and storage accounts. This approach enables you to link multiple Azure resources to virtual networks to improve security and provide optimal routing between resources.
### Communicate with on-premises resources
Azure virtual networks enable you to link resources together in your on-premises environment and within your Azure subscription. In effect, you can create a network that spans both your local and cloud environments. There are three mechanisms for you to achieve this connectivity:

- **Point-to-site virtual private networks** The typical approach to a virtual private network (VPN) connection is from a computer outside your organization, back into your corporate network. In this case, the client computer initiates an encrypted VPN connection to connect that computer to the Azure virtual network.
- **Site-to-site virtual private networks** A site-to-site VPN links your on-premises VPN device or gateway to the Azure VPN gateway in a virtual network. In effect, the devices in Azure can appear as being on the local network. The connection is encrypted and works over the internet.
- **Azure ExpressRoute** For environments where you need greater bandwidth and even higher levels of security, Azure ExpressRoute is the best approach. ExpressRoute provides a dedicated private connectivity to Azure that doesn't travel over the internet. (You'll learn more about ExpressRoute in a separate unit later in this module.)

### Route network traffic
By default, Azure routes traffic between subnets on any connected virtual networks, on-premises networks, and the internet. You can also control routing and override those settings, as follows:

- **Route tables** A route table allows you to define rules about how traffic should be directed. You can create custom route tables that control how packets are routed between subnets.
- **Border Gateway Protocol** Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) works with Azure VPN gateways, Azure Route Server, or ExpressRoute to propagate on-premises BGP routes to Azure virtual networks.

### Filter network traffic
Azure virtual networks enable you to filter traffic between subnets by using the following approaches:

- **Network security groups** A network security group is an Azure resource that can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules. You can define these rules to allow or block traffic, based on factors such as source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.
- **Network virtual appliances** A network virtual appliance is a specialized VM that can be compared to a hardened network appliance. A network virtual appliance carries out a particular network function, such as running a firewall or performing wide area network (WAN) optimization.

### Connect virtual networks
You can link virtual networks together by using virtual network peering. Peering enables resources in each virtual network to communicate with each other. These virtual networks can be in separate regions, which allows you to create a global interconnected network through Azure.

User-defined routes (UDR) are a significant update to Azure’s Virtual Networks that allows for greater control over network traffic flow. This method allows network administrators to control the routing tables between subnets within a VNet, as well as between VNets.

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/azure-networking-fundamentals/media/local-or-remote-gateway-in-peered-virual-network-21106a38.png)

## AzureVPN gateway

VPNs use an encrypted tunnel within another network. They're typically deployed to connect two or more trusted private networks to one another over an untrusted network (typically the public internet). Traffic is encrypted while traveling over the untrusted network to prevent eavesdropping or other attacks.

### Deploy VPN gateways
Before you can deploy a VPN gateway, you'll need some Azure and on-premises resources.

#### **Required Azure resources**
You'll need these Azure resources before you can deploy an operational VPN gateway:

Virtual network. Deploy a virtual network with enough address space for the additional subnet that you'll need for the VPN gateway. The address space for this virtual network must not overlap with the on-premises network that you'll be connecting to. You can deploy only one VPN gateway within a virtual network.

GatewaySubnet. Deploy a subnet called GatewaySubnet for the VPN gateway. Use at least a /27 address mask to make sure you have enough IP addresses in the subnet for future growth. You can't use this subnet for any other services.

Public IP address. Create a Basic-SKU dynamic public IP address if you're using a non-zone-aware gateway. This address provides a public-routable IP address as the target for your on-premises VPN device. This IP address is dynamic, but it won't change unless you delete and re-create the VPN gateway.

Local network gateway. Create a local network gateway to define the on-premises network's configuration, such as where the VPN gateway will connect and what it will connect to. This configuration includes the on-premises VPN device's public IPv4 address and the on-premises routable networks. This information is used by the VPN gateway to route packets that are destined for on-premises networks through the IPSec tunnel.

Virtual network gateway. Create the virtual network gateway to route traffic between the virtual network and the on-premises datacenter or other virtual networks. The virtual network gateway can be either a VPN or ExpressRoute gateway, but this unit only deals with VPN virtual network gateways. (You'll learn more about ExpressRoute in a separate unit later in this module.)

Connection. Create a connection resource to create a logical connection between the VPN gateway and the local network gateway.

The connection is made to the on-premises VPN device's IPv4 address as defined by the local network gateway.
The connection is made from the virtual network gateway and its associated public IP address.
You can create multiple connections.

The following diagram shows this combination of resources and their relationships to help you better understand what's required to deploy a VPN gateway.

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/azure-networking-fundamentals/media/resource-requirements-for-vpn-gateway-2518703e.png)

#### **Required on-premises resources**
To connect your datacenter to a VPN gateway, you'll need these on-premises resources:

A VPN device that supports policy-based or route-based VPN gateways
A public-facing (internet-routable) IPv4 address

### High-availability scenarios

- Active/standby

By default, VPN gateways are deployed as two instances in an active/standby configuration, even if you only see one VPN gateway resource in Azure. When planned maintenance or unplanned disruption affects the active instance, the standby instance automatically assumes responsibility for connections without any user intervention. Connections are interrupted during this failover, but they're typically restored within a few seconds for planned maintenance and within 90 seconds for unplanned disruptions.

- Active/ative

With the introduction of support for the BGP routing protocol, you can also deploy VPN gateways in an active/active configuration. In this configuration, you assign a unique public IP address to each instance. You then create separate tunnels from the on-premises device to each IP address. You can extend the high availability by deploying an additional VPN device on-premises.

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/azure-networking-fundamentals/media/dual-redundancy-d76100c9.png)


- ExpressRoute failover

Another high-availability option is to configure a VPN gateway as a secure failover path for ExpressRoute connections.

- Zone-redundant gateways

In regions that support availability zones, VPN gateways and ExpressRoute gateways can be deployed in a zone-redundant configuration.

## Azure ExpressRoute

ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection with the help of a connectivity provider. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365.
ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public Internet. This allows ExpressRoute connections to offer more reliability, faster speeds, consistent latencies, and higher security than typical connections over the Internet.

### Features and benefits of ExpressRoute

There are several benefits to using ExpressRoute as the connection service between Azure and on-premises networks.

- Layer 3 connectivity between your on-premises network and the Microsoft Cloud through a connectivity provider. Connectivity can be from an any-to-any (IPVPN) network, a point-to-point Ethernet connection, or through a virtual cross-connection via an Ethernet exchange.
- Connectivity to Microsoft cloud services across all regions in the geopolitical region.
- Global connectivity to Microsoft services across all regions with the ExpressRoute premium add-on.
- Dynamic routing between your network and Microsoft via BGP.
- Built-in redundancy in every peering location for higher reliability.
- Connection uptime SLA.
- QoS support for Skype for Business.

## ExpressRoute connectivity models

ExpressRoute supports the following models that you can use to connect your on-premises network to the Microsoft cloud:

- **CloudExchange colocation** 

Colocated providers can normally offer both Layer 2 and Layer 3 connections between your infrastructure, which might be located in the colocation facility, and the Microsoft cloud. For example, if your datacenter is colocated at a cloud exchange such as an ISP, you can request a virtual cross-connection to the Microsoft cloud.
- **Point-to-point Ethernet connection**

Point-to-point connections provide Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity between your on-premises site and Azure. You can connect your offices or datacenters to Azure by using the point-to-point links. For example, if you have an on-premises datacenter, you can use a point-to-point Ethernet link to connect to Microsoft.

- **Any-to-any connection**

With any-to-any connectivity, you can integrate your wide area network (WAN) with Azure by providing connections to your offices and datacenters. Azure integrates with your WAN connection to provide a connection like you would have between your datacenter and any branch offices.

- **Directly from ExpressRoute sites**

You can connect directly into the Microsoft's global network at a peering location strategically distributed across the world. ExpressRoute Direct provides dual 100 Gbps or 10-Gbps connectivity, which supports Active/Active connectivity at scale.

## Azure Storage 

### Disk storage

Disk Storage provides disks for Azure virtual machines. Applications and other services can access and use these disks as needed, similar to how they would in on-premises scenarios. Disk Storage allows data to be persistently stored and accessed from an attached virtual hard disk.

Disks come in many different sizes and performance levels, from solid-state drives (SSDs) to traditional spinning hard disk drives (HDDs), with varying performance tiers. You can use standard SSD and HDD disks for less critical workloads, premium SSD disks for mission-critical production applications, and ultra disks for data-intensive workloads such as SAP HANA, top tier databases, and transaction-heavy workloads. Azure has consistently delivered enterprise-grade durability for infrastructure as a service (Iaas) disks, with an industry-leading ZERO% annualized failure rate.

### Aure Blob storage

Azure Blob Storage is an object storage solution for the cloud. It can store massive amounts of data, such as text or binary data. Azure Blob Storage is unstructured, meaning that there are no restrictions on the kinds of data it can hold

Blob Storage is ideal for:

- Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
- Storing files for distributed access.
- Streaming video and audio.
- Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
- Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.
- Storing up to 8 TB of data for virtual machines.

Azure Storage offers different access tiers for your blob storage, helping you store object data in the most cost-effective manner. The available access tiers include:

Hot access tier: Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently (for example, images for your website).
Cool access tier: Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days (for example, invoices for your customers).
Archive access tier: Appropriate for data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days, with flexible latency requirements (for example, long-term backups).
The following considerations apply to the different access tiers:

Only the hot and cool access tiers can be set at the account level. The archive access tier isn't available at the account level.
Hot, cool, and archive tiers can be set at the blob level, during upload or after upload.
Data in the cool access tier can tolerate slightly lower availability, but still requires high durability, retrieval latency, and throughput characteristics similar to hot data. For cool data, a slightly lower availability service-level agreement (SLA) and higher access costs compared to hot data are acceptable trade-offs for lower storage costs.
Archive storage stores data offline and offers the lowest storage costs, but also the highest costs to rehydrate and access data.

### Azure Files

Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block and Network File System (preview) protocols. Azure file shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments of Windows, Linux, and macOS. Applications running in Azure virtual machines or cloud services can mount a file storage share to access file data, just as a desktop application would mount a typical SMB share

## DATABASES AZURE

### Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service. You can elastically and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure regions worldwide. You can take advantage of fast, single-digit-millisecond data access by using any one of several popular APIs. Azure Cosmos DB provides comprehensive service level agreements for throughput, latency, availability, and consistency guarantees.

Azure Cosmos DB is flexible. At the lowest level, Azure Cosmos DB stores data in atom-record-sequence (ARS) format. The data is then abstracted and projected as an API, which you specify when you're creating your database. Your choices include SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Tables, and Gremlin.

### Azure SQL Database

Azure SQL Database is a relational database based on the latest stable version of the Microsoft SQL Server database engine. SQL Database is a high-performance, reliable, fully managed, and secure database. You can use it to build data-driven applications and websites in the programming language of your choice, without needing to manage infrastructure.

Azure SQL Database is a platform as a service (PaaS) database engine. It handles most of the database-management functions — such as upgrading, patching, backups, and monitoring — without user involvement. SQL Database provides 99.99 percent availability. 

You can migrate your existing SQL Server databases with minimal downtime by using the **Azure Database Migration Service**. The Microsoft Data Migration Assistant can generate assessment reports that provide recommendations to help guide you through required changes prior to performing a migration. After you assess and resolve any remediation required, you're ready to begin the migration process. The Azure Database Migration Service performs all of the required steps. You'll just change the connection string in your apps.


### Azure database for MySQL

Azure Database for MySQL is a relational database service in the cloud, and it's based on the MySQL Community Edition database engine, versions 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0. With it, you have a 99.99 percent availability service-level agreement from Azure, powered by a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters. This helps keep your app running 24/7. With every Azure Database for MySQL server, you take advantage of built-in security, fault tolerance, and data protection that you would otherwise have to buy or design, build, and manage. With Azure Database for MySQL, you can use point-in-time restore to recover a server to an earlier state, as far back as 35 days.

Azure Database for MySQL delivers:

### Azure Database for PostgreSQL

Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a relational database service in the cloud. The server software is based on the community version of the open-source PostgreSQL database engine. Your familiarity with tools and expertise with PostgreSQL is applicable when you're using Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

Moreover, Azure Database for PostgreSQL delivers the following benefits:

- Built-in high availability compared to on-premises resources. There's no additional configuration, replication, or cost required to make sure your applications are always available.
- Simple and flexible pricing. You have predictable performance based on a selected pricing tier choice that includes software patching, automatic backups, monitoring, and security.
- Scale up or down as needed, within seconds. You can scale compute or storage independently as needed to make sure you adapt your service to match usage.
- Adjustable automatic backups and point-in-time-restore for up to 35 days.
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance to protect sensitive data at rest and in motion. This security covers data encryption on disk and SSL encryption between client and server communication.

Azure Database for PostgreSQL is available in two deployment options: Single Server and Hyperscale (Citus).

#### **Single Server**

The Single Server deployment option delivers:

 - Built-in high availability with no additional cost (99.99 percent SLA).
- Predictable performance and inclusive, pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Vertical scale as needed, within seconds.
- Monitoring and alerting to assess your server.
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance.

- Automatic backups and point-in-time restore for up to 35 days.

The Single Server deployment option offers three pricing tiers: Basic, General Purpose, and Memory Optimized. Each tier offers different resource capabilities to support your database workloads. 

#### **Hyperscale (Citus)**

The Hyperscale (Citus) option horizontally scales queries across multiple machines by using sharding. Its query engine parallelizes incoming SQL queries across these servers for faster responses on large datasets. It serves applications that require greater scale and performance, generally workloads that are approaching, or already exceed, 100 GB of data.

The Hyperscale (Citus) deployment option supports multi-tenant applications, real-time operational analytics, and high-throughput transactional workloads. Applications built for PostgreSQL can run distributed queries on Hyperscale (Citus) with standard connection libraries and minimal changes.

### Azure SQL Managed Instance

Azure SQL Managed Instance is a scalable cloud data service that provides the broadest SQL Server database engine compatibility with all the benefits of a fully managed platform as a service. Depending on your scenario, Azure SQL Managed Instance might offer more options for your database needs.

For a detailed list of the differences between Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance, see  [Features comparison: Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/features-comparison?view=azuresql)! 

### Big data and analytics

Open-source cluster technologies have been developed, over time, to try to deal with these large datasets. Microsoft Azure supports a broad range of technologies and services to provide big data and analytic solutions, including Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure HDInsight, Azure Databricks, and Azure Data Lake Analytics.

#### **Azure Synapse Analytics**

Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly Azure SQL Data Warehouse) is a limitless analytics service that brings together enterprise-data warehousing and big-data analytics. You can query data on your terms by using either serverless or provisioned resources at scale. You have a unified experience to ingest, prepare, manage, and serve data for immediate business intelligence and machine learning needs.

#### **Azure HDInsight**

Azure HDInsight is a fully managed, open-source analytics service for enterprises. It's a cloud service that makes it easier, faster, and more cost-effective to process massive amounts of data. You can run popular open-source frameworks and create cluster types such as Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, Apache HBase, Apache Storm, and Machine Learning Services. HDInsight also supports a broad range of scenarios such as extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), data warehousing, machine learning, and IoT.

#### **Azure Databricks**

Azure Databricks helps you unlock insights from all your data and build artificial intelligence solutions. You can set up your Apache Spark environment in minutes, then autoscale and collaborate on shared projects in an interactive workspace. Azure Databricks supports Python, Scala, R, Java, and SQL, as well as data science frameworks and libraries including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

#### **Azure Data Lake Analytics**

Azure Data Lake Analytics is an on-demand analytics job service that simplifies big data. Instead of deploying, configuring, and tuning hardware, you can write queries to transform your data and extract valuable insights. The analytics service can handle jobs of any scale instantly by setting the dial for how much power you need. You only pay for your job when it's running, making it more cost-effective.

## IOT

### Azure IoT Hub

Azure IoT Hub is a managed service that's hosted in the cloud and that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud-hosted solution back end. You can connect virtually any device to your IoT hub.

### Azure IoT Central
Azure IoT Central builds on top of IoT Hub by adding a dashboard that allows you to connect, monitor, and manage your IoT devices. The visual user interface (UI) makes it easy to quickly connect new devices and watch as they begin sending telemetry or error messages. You can watch the overall performance across all devices in aggregate, and you can set up alerts that send notifications when a specific device needs maintenance. Finally, you can push firmware updates to the device.

Azure Sphere creates an end-to-end, highly secure IoT solution for customers that encompasses everything from the hardware and operating system on the device to the secure method of sending messages from the device to the message hub. Azure Sphere has built-in communication and security features for internet-connected devices.

Azure Sphere comes in three parts:

- The first part is the Azure Sphere micro-controller unit (MCU), which is responsible for processing the operating system and signals from attached sensors. 

- The second part is a customized Linux operating system (OS) that handles communication with the security service and can run the vendor's software.

- The third part is Azure Sphere Security Service, also known as AS3. Its job is to make sure that the device has not been maliciously compromised. When the device attempts to connect to Azure, it first must authenticate itself, per device, which it does by using certificate-based authentication.

## IA

AI is a broad classification of computing that allows a software system to perceive its environment and take action that maximizes its chance of successfully achieving its goals. A goal of AI is to create a software system that's able to adapt, or learn something on its own without being explicitly programmed to do it.

There are two basic approaches to AI. The first is to employ a deep learning system that's modeled on the neural network of the human mind, enabling it to discover, learn, and grow through experience.

The second approach is machine learning, a data science technique that uses existing data to train a model, test it, and then apply the model to new data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends.

### **Azure Machine Learning**
Azure Machine Learning is a platform for making predictions. It consists of tools and services that allow you to connect to data to train and test models to find one that will most accurately predict a future result. After you've run experiments to test the model, you can deploy and use it in real time via a web API endpoint.

Choose Azure Machine Learning when your data scientists need complete control over the design and training of an algorithm using your own data. The following video discusses the basic steps required to set up a machine learning system.

### **Azure Cognitive Services**
Azure Cognitive Services provides prebuilt machine learning models that enable applications to see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason. Use Azure Cognitive Services to solve general problems, such as analyzing text for emotional sentiment or analyzing images to recognize objects or faces. You don't need special machine learning or data science knowledge to use these services. Developers access Azure Cognitive Services via APIs and can easily include these features in just a few lines of code.

While Azure Machine Learning requires you to bring your own data and train models over that data, Azure Cognitive Services, for the most part, provides pretrained models so that you can bring in your live data to get predictions on.

Azure Cognitive Services can be divided into the following categories:

- Language services: Allow your apps to process natural language with prebuilt scripts, evaluate sentiment, and learn how to recognize what users want.
- Speech services: Convert speech into text and text into natural-sounding speech. Translate from one language to another and enable speaker verification and recognition.
- Vision services: Add recognition and identification capabilities when you're analyzing pictures, videos, and other visual content.
- Decision services: Add personalized recommendations for each user that automatically improve each time they're used, moderate content to monitor and remove offensive or risky content, and detect abnormalities in your time series data.

### **Azure Bot Service**
Azure Bot Service and Bot Framework are platforms for creating virtual agents that understand and reply to questions just like a human. Azure Bot Service is a bit different from Azure Machine Learning and Azure Cognitive Services in that it has a specific use case. Namely, it creates a virtual agent that can intelligently communicate with humans. Behind the scenes, the bot you build uses other Azure services, such as Azure Cognitive Services, to understand what their human counterparts are asking for.

## Azure Serverless.

As mentioned in the video, serverless computing is a cloud-hosted execution environment that runs your code but abstracts the underlying hosting environment. The term serverless computing is a misnomer. After all, there is a server (or a group of servers) that executes your code or desired functionality.

The key idea is that you're not responsible for setting up or maintaining the server. You don't have to worry about scaling it when there's increased demand, and you don't have to worry about outages. The cloud vendor takes care of all maintenance and scaling concerns for you.

You can call Azure Functions from Azure Logic Apps, and vice versa. The primary difference between the two services is their intent. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service, and Azure Logic Apps is intended to be a serverless orchestration service.

### Azure Functions
With the Azure Functions service, you can host a single method or function by using a popular programming language in the cloud that runs in response to an event. An example of an event might be an HTTP request, a new message on a queue, or a message on a timer.

Because of its atomic nature, Azure Functions can serve many purposes in an application's design. Functions can be written in many common programming languages, such as C#, Python, JavaScript, Typescript, Java, and PowerShell.

An Azure function is a stateless environment. A function behaves as if it's restarted every time it responds to an event. This feature is ideal for processing incoming data. And if state is required, the function can be connected to an Azure storage account.

Azure Functions can perform orchestration tasks by using an extension called Durable Functions, which allow developers to chain functions together while maintaining state.

The Azure Functions solution is ideal when you're concerned only with the code that's running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure.

### Azure Logic Apps
Logic Apps is a low-code/no-code development platform hosted as a cloud service. The service helps you automate and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps, data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations. Logic Apps simplifies how you design and build scalable solutions, whether in the cloud, on-premises, or both. This solution covers app integration, data integration, system integration, enterprise application integration (EAI), and business-to-business (B2B) integration.

To build enterprise integration solutions with Azure Logic Apps, you can choose from a growing gallery of over 200 connectors. The gallery includes services such as Salesforce, SAP, Oracle DB, and file shares.

If you can't find the action or connector you need, you can build your own by using custom code.

## DevOps

### Azure DevOps Services
Azure DevOps Services is a suite of services that address every stage of the software development lifecycle.

Azure Repos is a centralized source-code repository where software development, DevOps engineering, and documentation professionals can publish their code for review and collaboration.
Azure Boards is an agile project management suite that includes Kanban boards, reporting, and tracking ideas and work from high-level epics to work items and issues.
Azure Pipelines is a CI/CD pipeline automation tool.
Azure Artifacts is a repository for hosting artifacts, such as compiled source code, which can be fed into testing or deployment pipeline steps.
Azure Test Plans is an automated test tool that can be used in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure quality before a software release.

### GitHub and GitHub Actions
GitHub is arguably the world's most popular code repository for open-source software. Git is a decentralized source-code management tool, and GitHub is a hosted version of Git that serves as the primary remote. GitHub builds on top of Git to provide related services for coordinating work, reporting and discussing issues, providing documentation, and more. It offers the following functionality:

It's a shared source-code repository, including tools that enable developers to perform code reviews by adding comments and questions in a web view of the source code before it can be merged into the main code base.
It facilitates project management, including Kanban boards.
It supports issue reporting, discussion, and tracking.
It features CI/CD pipeline automation tooling.
It includes a wiki for collaborative documentation.
It can be run from the cloud or on-premises

### Azure DevTest Labs
Azure DevTest Labs provides an automated means of managing the process of building, setting up, and tearing down virtual machines (VMs) that contain builds of your software projects. This way, developers and testers can perform tests across a variety of environments and builds. And this capability isn't limited to VMs. Anything you can deploy in Azure via an ARM template can be provisioned through DevTest Labs. Provisioning pre-created lab environments with their required configurations and tools already installed is a huge time saver for quality assurance professionals and developers.

## Manage and configure azure

There are two approaches to infrastructure as code: imperative code and declarative code. Imperative code details each individual step that should be performed to achieve a desired outcome. By contrast, declarative code details only a desired outcome, and it allows an interpreter to decide how to best achieve that outcome.

### The Azure portal
By using the Azure portal, a web-based user interface, you can access virtually every feature of Azure. The Azure portal provides a friendly, graphical UI to view all the services you're using, create new services, configure your services, and view reports.

### The Azure mobile app
The Azure mobile app provides iOS and Android access to your Azure resources when you're away from your computer. With it, you can:

Monitor the health and status of your Azure resources.
Check for alerts, quickly diagnose and fix issues, and restart a web app or virtual machine (VM).
Run the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell commands to manage your Azure resources.

### Azure PowerShell
Azure PowerShell is a shell with which developers and DevOps and IT professionals can execute commands called cmdlets (pronounced command-lets). These commands call the Azure Rest API to perform every possible management task in Azure. 

Azure PowerShell is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac, and you can access it in a web browser via Azure Cloud Shell.

### The Azure CLI
The Azure CLI command-line interface is an executable program with which a developer, DevOps professional, or IT professional can execute commands in Bash. The commands call the Azure Rest API to perform every possible management task in Azure. You can run the commands independently or combined into a script and executed together for the routine setup, teardown, and maintenance of a single resource or an entire environment.

### ARM templates
Although it's possible to write imperative code in Azure PowerShell or the Azure CLI to set up and tear down one Azure resource or orchestrate an infrastructure comprising hundreds of resources, there's a better way to implement this functionality.

By using Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates), you can describe the resources you want to use in a declarative JSON format.


## Monitoring

At a high level, there are three primary Azure monitoring offerings, each of which is aimed at a specific audience and use case and provides a diverse set of tools, services, programmatic APIs, and more.

### Azure Advisor
Azure Advisor evaluates your Azure resources and makes recommendations to help improve reliability, security, and performance, achieve operational excellence, and reduce costs. Advisor is designed to help you save time on cloud optimization.

- Reliability: Used to ensure and improve the continuity of your business-critical applications.
- Security: Used to detect threats and vulnerabilities that might lead to security breaches.
- Performance: Used to improve the speed of your applications.
- Cost: Used to optimize and reduce your overall Azure spending.
- Operational Excellence: Used to help you achieve process and workflow efficiency, resource manageability, and deployment best practices.

### Azure Monitor
Azure Monitor is a platform for collecting, analyzing, visualizing, and potentially taking action based on the metric and logging data from your entire Azure and on-premises environment.

The following diagram illustrates just how comprehensive Azure Monitor is.

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/monitoring-fundamentals/media/2-identify-product-options-01.png)

- On the left is a list of the sources of logging and metric data that can be collected at every layer in your application architecture, from application to operating system and network.

- In the center, you can see how the logging and metric data is stored in central repositories.

- On the right, the data is used in a number of ways. You can view real-time and historical performance across each layer of your architecture, or aggregated and detailed information. The data is displayed at different levels for different audiences. You can view high-level reports on the Azure Monitor Dashboard or create custom views by using Power BI and Kusto queries.

### Azure Service Health
Azure Service Health provides a personalized view of the health of the Azure services, regions, and resources you rely on. The status.azure.com website, which displays only major issues that broadly affect Azure customers, doesn't provide the full picture. But Azure Service Health displays both major and smaller, localized issues that affect you. Service issues are rare, but it's important to be prepared for the unexpected. You can set up alerts that help you triage outages and planned maintenance

## Secure Network

You can visualize defense in depth as a set of layers, with the data to be secured at the center.

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/secure-network-connectivity-azure/media/2-defense-depth.png)

Here's a brief overview of the role of each layer:

- The physical security layer is the first line of defense to protect computing hardware in the datacenter.
- The identity and access layer controls access to infrastructure and change control.
- The perimeter layer uses distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
- The network layer limits communication between resources through segmentation and access controls.
- The compute layer secures access to virtual machines.
- The application layer helps ensure that applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities.
- The data layer controls access to business and customer data that you need to protect.

### Azure Firewall
Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that helps protect resources in your Azure virtual networks. A virtual network is similar to a traditional network that you'd operate in your own datacenter. It's a fundamental building block for your private network that enables virtual machines and other compute resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

Azure Firewall is a stateful firewall. A stateful firewall analyzes the complete context of a network connection, not just an individual packet of network traffic. Azure Firewall features high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.

With Azure Firewall, you can configure:

Application rules that define fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) that can be accessed from a subnet.
Network rules that define source address, protocol, destination port, and destination address.
Network Address Translation (NAT) rules that define destination IP addresses and ports to translate inbound requests.

### Azure DDoS Protection

What are DDoS attacks?
A distributed denial of service attack attempts to overwhelm and exhaust an application's resources, making the application slow or unresponsive to legitimate users. DDoS attacks can target any resource that's publicly reachable through the internet, including websites.

Azure DDoS Protection (Standard) helps protect your Azure resources from DDoS attacks.

When you combine DDoS Protection with recommended application design practices, you help provide a defense against DDoS attacks. DDoS Protection uses the scale and elasticity of Microsoft's global network to bring DDoS mitigation capacity to every Azure region. The DDoS Protection service helps protect your Azure applications by analyzing and discarding DDoS traffic at the Azure network edge, before it can affect your service's availability.

DDoS Protection identifies the attacker's attempt to overwhelm the network and blocks further traffic from them, ensuring that traffic never reaches Azure resources. Legitimate traffic from customers still flows into Azure without any interruption of service.

DDoS Protection provides these service tiers:

- **Basic**

The Basic service tier is automatically enabled for free as part of your Azure subscription.

Always-on traffic monitoring and real-time mitigation of common network-level attacks provide the same defenses that Microsoft's online services use. The Basic service tier ensures that Azure infrastructure itself is not affected during a large-scale DDoS attack.

The Azure global network is used to distribute and mitigate attack traffic across Azure regions.

- **Standard**

The Standard service tier provides additional mitigation capabilities that are tuned specifically to Azure Virtual Network resources. DDoS Protection Standard is relatively easy to enable and requires no changes to your applications.

The Standard tier provides always-on traffic monitoring and real-time mitigation of common network-level attacks. It provides the same defenses that Microsoft's online services use.

Protection policies are tuned through dedicated traffic monitoring and machine learning algorithms. Policies are applied to public IP addresses, which are associated with resources deployed in virtual networks such as Azure Load Balancer and Application Gateway.

The Azure global network is used to distribute and mitigate attack traffic across Azure regions.

The Standard service tier can help prevent:

Volumetric attacks

The goal of this attack is to flood the network layer with a substantial amount of seemingly legitimate traffic.

Protocol attacks

These attacks render a target inaccessible by exploiting a weakness in the layer 3 and layer 4 protocol stack.

Resource-layer (application-layer) attacks (only with web application firewall)

These attacks target web application packets to disrupt the transmission of data between hosts. You need a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against L7 attacks. DDoS Protection Standard protects the WAF from volumetric and protocol attacks.

### network security groups

A network security group enables you to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources within an Azure virtual network. You can think of NSGs like an internal firewall. An NSG can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules that enable you to filter traffic to and from resources by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.

A network security group can contain as many rules as you need, within Azure subscription limits. Each rule specifies these properties:

|Property|	Description|
|-|-|
|Name| A unique name for the NSG.|
|Priority|A number between 100 and 4096.Rules are processed in priority order, with lower numbers processed before higher numbers.|
|Source or Destination|A single IP address or IP address range, service tag, or application security group.|
|Protocol|TCP, UDP, or Any.|
|Direction|Whether the rule applies to inbound or outbound traffic.|
|Port Range|A single port or range of ports.|
|Action|	Allow or Deny.|

### secure recommendations 

Here are some recommendations on how to combine Azure services to create a complete network security solution.

Secure the perimeter layer
The perimeter layer is about protecting your organization's resources from network-based attacks. Identifying these attacks, alerting the appropriate security teams, and eliminating their impact are important to keeping your network secure. To do this:

Use Azure DDoS Protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
Use perimeter firewalls with Azure Firewall to identify and alert on malicious attacks against your network.
Secure the network layer
At this layer, the focus is on limiting network connectivity across all of your resources to allow only what's required. Segment your resources and use network-level controls to restrict communication to only what's needed.

By restricting connectivity, you reduce the risk of lateral movement throughout your network from an attack. Use network security groups to create rules that define allowed inbound and outbound communication at this layer. Here are some recommended practices:

Limit communication between resources by segmenting your network and configuring access controls.
Deny by default.
Restrict inbound internet access and limit outbound where appropriate.
Implement secure connectivity to on-premises networks.
Combine services
You can combine Azure networking and security services to manage your network security and provide increased layered protection. Here are two ways you can combine services:

Network security groups and Azure Firewall

Azure Firewall complements the functionality of network security groups. Together, they provide better defense-in-depth network security.

Network security groups provide distributed network-layer traffic filtering to limit traffic to resources within virtual networks in each subscription.

Azure Firewall is a fully stateful, centralized network firewall as a service. It provides network-level and application-level protection across different subscriptions and virtual networks.

Azure Application Gateway web application firewall and Azure Firewall

Web application firewall (WAF) is a feature of Azure Application Gateway that provides your web applications with centralized, inbound protection against common exploits and vulnerabilities.

Azure Firewall provides:

Inbound protection for non-HTTP/S protocols (for example, RDP, SSH, and FTP).
Outbound network-level protection for all ports and protocols.
Application-level protection for outbound HTTP/S.
Combining them provides more layers of protection.
	
## Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center is a monitoring service that provides visibility of your security posture across all of your services, both on Azure and on-premises. The term security posture refers to cybersecurity policies and controls, as well as how well you can predict, prevent, and respond to security threats.

Security Center can:

Monitor security settings across on-premises and cloud workloads.
Automatically apply required security settings to new resources as they come online.
Provide security recommendations that are based on your current configurations, resources, and networks.
Continuously monitor your resources and perform automatic security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities before those vulnerabilities can be exploited.
Use machine learning to detect and block malware from being installed on your virtual machines (VMs) and other resources. You can also use adaptive application controls to define rules that list allowed applications to ensure that only applications you allow can run.
Detect and analyze potential inbound attacks and investigate threats and any post-breach activity that might have occurred.
Provide just-in-time access control for network ports. Doing so reduces your attack surface by ensuring that the network only allows traffic that you require at the time that you need it to.


**Secure score** is a measurement of an organization's security posture.
	
Secure score helps you:

- Report on the current state of your organization's security posture.
- Improve your security posture by providing discoverability, visibility, guidance, and control.
- Compare with benchmarks and establish key performance indicators (KPIs).

####**Protect against threats**
Security Center includes advanced cloud defense capabilities for VMs, network security, and file integrity. 

- Just-in-time VM access Tailwind Traders will configure just-in-time access to VMs. This access blocks traffic by default to specific network ports of VMs, but allows traffic for a specified time when an admin requests and approves it.
- Adaptive application controls  can control which applications are allowed to run on its VMs. In the background, Security Center uses machine learning to look at the processes running on a VM. It creates exception rules for each resource group that holds the VMs and provides recommendations. This process provides alerts that inform the company about unauthorized applications that are running on its VMs.
- Adaptive network hardening Security Center can monitor the internet traffic patterns of the VMs, and compare those patterns with the company's current network security group (NSG) settings. From there, Security Center can make recommendations about whether the NSGs should be locked down further and provide remediation steps.
- File integrity monitoring  Traders can also configure the monitoring of changes to important files on both Windows and Linux, registry settings, applications, and other aspects that might indicate a security attack.

### Azure Sentinel

Security management on a large scale can benefit from a dedicated security information and event management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system aggregates security data from many different sources (as long as those sources support an open-standard logging format). It also provides capabilities for threat detection and response.

Azure Sentinel is Microsoft's cloud-based SIEM system. It uses intelligent security analytics and threat analysis.

Azure Sentinel enables you to:

- Collect cloud data at scale Collect data across all users, devices, applications, and infrastructure, both on-premises and from multiple clouds.
- Detect previously undetected threats Minimize false positives by using Microsoft's comprehensive analytics and threat intelligence.
- Investigate threats with artificial intelligence Examine suspicious activities at scale, tapping into years of cybersecurity experience from Microsoft.
- Respond to incidents rapidly Use built-in orchestration and automation of common tasks.

Azure Sentinel supports a number of data sources, which it can analyze for security events. These connections are handled by built-in connectors or industry-standard log formats and APIs.

- Connect Microsoft solutions Connectors provide real-time integration for services like Microsoft Threat Protection solutions, Microsoft 365 sources (including Office 365), Azure Active Directory, and Windows Defender Firewall.
- Connect other services and solutions Connectors are available for common non-Microsoft services and solutions, including AWS CloudTrail, Citrix Analytics (Security), Sophos XG Firewall, VMware Carbon Black Cloud, and Okta SSO.
- Connect industry-standard data sources Azure Sentinel supports data from other sources that use the Common Event Format (CEF) messaging standard, Syslog, or REST API.

## Azure Key Vault

Azure Key Vault is a centralized cloud service for storing an application's secrets in a single, central location. It provides secure access to sensitive information by providing access control and logging capabilities.

Azure Key Vault can help you:

- Manage secrets You can use Key Vault to securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets.
- Manage encryption keys You can use Key Vault as a key management solution. Key Vault makes it easier to create and control the encryption keys that are used to encrypt your data.
- Manage SSL/TLS certificates Key Vault enables you to provision, manage, and deploy your public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for both your Azure resources and your internal resources.
- Store secrets backed by hardware security modules (HSMs) These secrets and keys can be protected either by software or by FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs.

## Azure Dedicated Host

Some organizations must follow regulatory compliance that requires them to be the only customer using the physical machine that hosts their virtual machines. Azure Dedicated Host provides dedicated physical servers to host your Azure VMs for Windows and Linux.

benefict of Azure Dedicated Host:

- Gives you visibility into, and control over, the server infrastructure that's running your Azure VMs.
- Helps address compliance requirements by deploying your workloads on an isolated server.
- Lets you choose the number of processors, server capabilities, VM series, and VM sizes within the same host.


You're charged per dedicated host, independent of how many VMs you deploy to it. The host price is based on the VM family, type (hardware size), and region.

Software licensing, storage, and network usage are billed separately from the host and VMs. 


## SECURE AZURE

### Authentication (AuthN)
Authentication is the process of establishing the identity of a person or service that wants to access a resource. It involves the act of challenging a party for legitimate credentials and provides the basis for creating a security principal for identity and access control. It establishes whether the user is who they say they are.

### Authorization (AuthZ)
Authentication establishes the user's identity, but authorization is the process of establishing what level of access an authenticated person or service has. It specifies what data they're allowed to access and what they can do with it.


### Azure Active Directory

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides identity services that enable your users to sign in and access both Microsoft cloud applications and cloud applications that you develop. You also learn how Azure AD supports single sign-on (SSO).

Azure AD provides services such as:

- Authentication

This includes verifying identity to access applications and resources. It also includes providing functionality such as self-service password reset, multifactor authentication, a custom list of banned passwords, and smart lockout services.

- Single sign-on

SSO enables you to remember only one username and one password to access multiple applications. A single identity is tied to a user, which simplifies the security model. As users change roles or leave an organization, access modifications are tied to that identity, which greatly reduces the effort needed to change or disable accounts.

- Application management

You can manage your cloud and on-premises apps by using Azure AD. Features like Application Proxy, SaaS apps, the My Apps portal (also called the access panel), and single sign-on provide a better user experience.

- Device management

Along with accounts for individual people, Azure AD supports the registration of devices. Registration enables devices to be managed through tools like Microsoft Intune. It also allows for device-based Conditional Access policies to restrict access attempts to only those coming from known devices, regardless of the requesting user account.

### Connect Active Directory with Azure AD
Connecting Active Directory with Azure AD enables you to provide a consistent identity experience to your users.

There are a few ways to connect your existing Active Directory installation with Azure AD. Perhaps the most popular method is to use Azure AD Connect.

Azure AD Connect synchronizes user identities between on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD. Azure AD Connect synchronizes changes between both identity systems, so you can use features like SSO, multifactor authentication, and self-service password reset under both systems. Self-service password reset prevents users from using known compromised passwords.

Here's a diagram that shows how Azure AD Connect fits between on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD:

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/secure-access-azure-identity-services/media/3-azure-ad-connect.png)

## Multifactor authentication

Multifactor authentication is a process where a user is prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification. Examples include a code on their mobile phone or a fingerprint scan.

- **Something the user knows**

This might be an email address and password.

- **Something the user has**

This might be a code that's sent to the user's mobile phone.

- **Something the user is**

This is typically some sort of biometric property, such as a fingerprint or face scan that's used on many mobile devices.


### Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication

Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication is a Microsoft service that provides multifactor authentication capabilities. Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication enables users to choose an additional form of authentication during sign-in, such as a phone call or mobile app notification.

### Conditional Access

Conditional Access is a tool that Azure Active Directory uses to allow (or deny) access to resources based on identity signals. These signals include who the user is, where the user is, and what device the user is requesting access from.

Conditional Access helps IT administrators:

- Empower users to be productive wherever and whenever.
- Protect the organization's assets.

To use Conditional Access, you need an Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license. If you have a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license, you also have access to Conditional Access features.

## Governance Azure

### Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)

Access management for cloud resources is a critical function for any organization that is using the cloud. Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) helps you manage who has access to Azure resources, what they can do with those resources, and what areas they have access to.

Azure RBAC is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager that provides fine-grained access management of Azure resources.

Role-based access control is applied to a scope, which is a resource or set of resources that this access applies to.

Here's a diagram that shows the relationship between roles and scopes.

A diagram showing scopes along the Y axis and roles across the X axis. Role and scope combinations each map to a specific kind of user or account, such as an observer or an administrator.

Scopes include:

- A management group (a collection of multiple subscriptions).
- A single subscription.
- A resource group.
- A single resource.

**Observers**, Users managing resources, Admins, and Automated processes illustrate the kinds of users or accounts that would typically be assigned each of the various roles.

When you grant access at a parent scope, those permissions are inherited by all child scopes. For example:

When you assign the **Owner** role to a user at the management group scope, that user can manage everything in all subscriptions within the management group.

When you assign the **Reader** role to a group at the subscription scope, the members of that group can view every resource group and resource within the subscription.

When you assign the **Contributor** role to an application at the resource group scope, the application can manage resources of all types within that resource group, but not other resource groups within the subscription.

Use Azure RBAC when you need to:

- Allow one user to manage VMs in a subscription and another user to manage virtual networks.
- Allow a database administrator group to manage SQL databases in a subscription.
- Allow a user to manage all resources in a resource group, such as virtual machines, websites, and subnets.
- Allow an application to access all resources in a resource group.


### Resource Lock

A resource lock prevents resources from being accidentally deleted or changed.

Even with Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) policies in place, there's still a risk that people with the right level of access could delete critical cloud resources. Think of a resource lock as a warning system that reminds you that a resource should not be deleted or changed.

#### levels of locking 
You can apply locks to a subscription, a resource group, or an individual resource. You can set the lock level to CanNotDelete or ReadOnly.

- CanNotDelete means authorized people can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource without first removing the lock.
- ReadOnly means authorized people can read a resource, but they can't delete or change the resource. Applying this lock is like restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role in Azure RBAC.


#### delete or change a locked resource
Although locking helps prevent accidental changes, you can still make changes by following a two-step process.

To modify a locked resource, you must first remove the lock. After you remove the lock, you can apply any action you have permissions to perform. This additional step allows the action to be taken, but it helps protect your administrators from doing something they might not have intended to do.

Resource locks apply regardless of RBAC permissions. Even if you're an owner of the resource, you must still remove the lock before you can perform the blocked activity.

### Tags

 Resource tags are another way to organize resources. Tags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources. This metadata is useful for:

- Resource management Tags enable you to locate and act on resources that are associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, and owners.
- Cost management and optimization Tags enable you to group resources so that you can report on costs, allocate internal cost centers, track budgets, and forecast estimated cost.
- Operations management Tags enable you to group resources according to how critical their availability is to your business. This grouping helps you formulate service-level agreements (SLAs). An SLA is an uptime or performance guarantee between you and your users.
- Security Tags enable you to classify data by its security level, such as public or confidential.
- Governance and regulatory compliance Tags enable you to identify resources that align with governance or regulatory compliance requirements, such as ISO 27001. Tags can also be part of your standards enforcement efforts. For example, you might require that all resources be tagged with an owner or department name.
- Workload optimization and automation Tags can help you visualize all of the resources that participate in complex deployments. For example, you might tag a resource with its associated workload or application name and use software such as Azure DevOps to perform automated tasks on those resources.

A resource tag consists of a name and a value. You can assign one or more tags to each Azure resource.

**Example Tags**

|Name|Value|
|-|-|
|AppName|The name of the application that the resource is part of.|
|CostCenter|The internal cost center code.|
|Owner|The name of the business owner who's responsible for the resource.|
|Environment|An environment name, such as "Prod," "Dev," or "Test."|
|Impact|How important the resource is to business operations, such as "Mission-critical," "High-impact," or "Low-impact."|

Here's an example that shows these tags as they're applied to a virtual machine during provisioning.

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/build-cloud-governance-strategy-azure/media/8-vm-tags-7c63fa8a.png)


### Azure Policy

Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit your resources. These policies enforce different rules across all of your resource configurations so that those configurations stay compliant with corporate standards.

Azure Policy enables you to define both individual policies and groups of related policies, known as *initiatives*. Azure Policy evaluates your resources and highlights resources that aren't compliant with the policies you've created. Azure Policy can also prevent noncompliant resources from being created.

### Azure Policy initiatives

An Azure Policy initiative is a way of grouping related policies together. The initiative definition contains all of the policy definitions to help track your compliance state for a larger goal.

For example, Azure Policy includes an initiative named Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center. Its goal is to monitor all of the available security recommendations for all Azure resource types in Azure Security Center.

Under this initiative, the following policy definitions are included:

- Monitor unencrypted SQL Database in Security Center This policy monitors for unencrypted SQL databases and servers.
- Monitor OS vulnerabilities in Security Center This policy monitors servers that don't satisfy the configured OS vulnerability baseline.
- Monitor missing Endpoint Protection in Security Center This policy monitors for servers that don't have an installed endpoint protection agent.
In fact, the Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center initiative contains over 100 separate policy definitions.

Azure Policy also includes initiatives that support regulatory compliance standards, such as HIPAA and ISO 27001.

### Azure Blueprints 

Simplify largescale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager templates, role-based access controls, and policies, in a single blueprint definition. Easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions and environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

Azure Blueprints orchestrates the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts, such as:

- Role assignments
- Policy assignments
- Azure Resource Manager templates
- Resource groups

### Cloud Adoption Framework

Cloud Adoption Framework consists of tools, documentation, and proven practices. The Cloud Adoption Framework includes these stages:

1. Define your strategy.
2. Make a plan.
3. Ready your organization.
4. Adopt the cloud.
5. Govern and manage your cloud environments.

#### *Define strategy*

# AZ 104 Admin

## Azure Resource Manager template schema

Azure Resource Manager templates are written in JSON, which allows you to express data stored as an object (such as a virtual machine) in text. A JSON document is essentially a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is a string, whose value can be:

- A string
- A number
- A Boolean expression
- A list of values
- An object (which is a collection of other key-value pairs)

A Resource Manager template can contain sections that are expressed using JSON notation, but are not related to the JSON language itself:

```
{
    "$schema": "http://schema.management.​azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",​
    "contentVersion": "",​
    "parameters": {},​
    "variables": {},​
    "functions": [],​
    "resources": [],​
    "outputs": {}​
}
```

|Element name|Required|Description|
|-|-|-|
|$schema|Yes|Location of the JSON schema file that describes the version of the template language. Use the URL shown in the preceding example.|
|contentVersion|Yes|Version of the template (such as 1.0.0.0). You can provide any value for this element. Use this value to document significant changes in your template. When deploying resources using the template, this value can be used to make sure that the right template is being used.|
|parameters|No|Values that are provided when deployment is executed to customize resource deployment.|
|variables|No|Values that are used as JSON fragments in the template to simplify template language expressions.|
|functions|No|User-defined functions that are available within the template.|
|resources|Yes|Resource types that are deployed or updated in a resource group.|
|outputs|No|Values that are returned after deployment.|

In the parameters section of the template, you specify which values you can input when deploying the resources. The available properties for a parameter are:

```
"parameters": {
    "<parameter-name>" : {
        "type" : "<type-of-parameter-value>",
        "defaultValue": "<default-value-of-parameter>",
        "allowedValues": [ "<array-of-allowed-values>" ],
        "minValue": <minimum-value-for-int>,
        "maxValue": <maximum-value-for-int>,
        "minLength": <minimum-length-for-string-or-array>,
        "maxLength": <maximum-length-for-string-or-array-parameters>,
        "metadata": {
        "description": "<description-of-the parameter>"
        }
    }
}

```
Here's an example that illustrates two parameters: one for a virtual machine's username, and one for its password:

```
"parameters": {
  "adminUsername": {
    "type": "string",
    "metadata": {
      "description": "Username for the Virtual Machine."
    }
  },
  "adminPassword": {
    "type": "securestring",
    "metadata": {
      "description": "Password for the Virtual Machine."
    }
  }
}
```

## Bicep templates

Azure Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. It provides concise syntax, reliable type safety, and support for code reuse.

You can use Bicep instead of JSON to develop your Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates). The JSON syntax to create an ARM template can be verbose and require complicated expressions. Bicep syntax reduces that complexity and improves the development experience.

Bicep provides many improvements over JSON for template authoring, including:

- **Simpler syntax:** Bicep provides a simpler syntax for writing templates. You can reference parameters and variables directly, without using complicated functions. String interpolation is used in place of concatenation to combine values for names and other items. You can reference the properties of a resource directly by using its symbolic name instead of complex reference statements. These syntax improvements help both with authoring and reading Bicep templates.

- **Modules:** You can break down complex template deployments into smaller module files and reference them in a main template. These modules provide easier management and greater reusability.

- **Automatic dependency management:** In most situations, Bicep automatically detects dependencies between your resources. This process removes some of the work involved in template authoring.

- **Type validation and IntelliSense:** The Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code features rich validation and IntelliSense for all Azure resource type API definitions. This feature helps provide an easier authoring experience.

[Azure Quickstart](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/templates/) Templates are Azure Resource Manager templates provided by the Azure community.

Some templates provide everything you need to deploy your solution, while others might serve as a starting point for your template. Either way, you can study these templates to learn how to best author and structure your own templates.

The README.md file provides an overview of what the template does.

The azuredeploy.json file defines the resources that will be deployed.

The azuredeploy.parameters.json file provides the values the template needs.

## POWERSHELL

A PowerShell command is called a cmdlet (pronounced "command-let"). A cmdlet is a command that manipulates a single feature. The term cmdlet is intended to imply "small command". By convention, cmdlet authors are encouraged to keep cmdlets simple and single-purpose.

Cmdlets follow a verb-noun naming convention; for example, Get-Process, Format-Table, and Start-Service. There is also a convention for verb choice: "get" to retrieve data, "set" to insert or update data, "format" to format data, "out" to direct output to a destination, and so on.

Cmdlets are shipped in modules. A PowerShell Module is a DLL that includes the code to process each available cmdlet. You'll load cmdlets into PowerShell by loading the module in which they're contained

Az is the formal name for the Azure PowerShell module, which contains cmdlets to work with Azure features. It contains hundreds of cmdlets that let you control nearly every aspect of every Azure resource. You can work with resource groups, storage, virtual machines, Azure Active Directory, containers, machine learning, and so on.

### powershelcomandos AZ

- Connect-AzAccount

The Connect-AzAccount cmdlet prompts for your Azure credentials, then connects to your Azure subscription.

- Get a list of all resource groups
Get-AzResourceGroup

Get-AzResourceGroup | Format-Table

- Create a resource group
```
New-AzResourceGroup -Name <name> -Location <location>
```
- Verify the resources

Get-AzResource

Get-AzResource | Format-Table

Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName ExerciseResources

- Create an Azure Virtual Machine

**ResourceGroupName:** The resource group into which the new VM will be placed.

**Name:** The name of the VM in Azure.

**Location:** Geographic location where the VM will be provisioned.

**Credential:** An object containing the username and password for the VM admin account. We'll use the Get-Credential cmdlet. This cmdlet will prompt for a username and password and package it into a credential object.

**Image:** The operating system image to use for the VM, which is typically a Linux distribution or Windows Server.

```
New-AzVm
       -ResourceGroupName <resource group name>
       -Name <machine name>
       -Credential <credentials object>
       -Location <location>
       -Image <image name>
```

The AzVM suffix is specific to VM-based commands in PowerShell. There are several others you can use:

|Command	|Description|
|-|-|
Remove-AzVM	|Deletes an Azure VM.
Start-AzVM|	Start a stopped VM.
Stop-AzVM|	Stop a running VM.
Restart-AzVM|	Restart a VM.
Update-AzVM	|Updates the configuration for a VM.

### Create and save scripts in Azure PowerShell

Complex or repetitive tasks often take a great deal of administrative time. Organizations prefer to automate these tasks to reduce costs and avoid errors.

A PowerShell script is a text file containing commands and control constructs. The commands are invocations of cmdlets. The control constructs are programming features like loops, variables, parameters, comments, etc., supplied by PowerShell.

PowerShell script files have a .ps1 file extension. You can create and save these files with any text editor.

### PowerShell techniques

#### **Variables**
As you saw in the last unit, PowerShell supports variables. Use $ to declare a variable and = to assign a value. For example:

```
$loc = "East US"
$iterations = 3

$adminCredential = Get-Credential
```

To obtain the value stored in a variable, use the $ prefix and its name, as in the following:

```
$loc = "East US"
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "MyResourceGroup" -Location $loc
```
#### **Loops**

PowerShell has several loops: For, Do...While, For...Each, and so on. The For loop is the best match for our needs, because we will execute a cmdlet a fixed number of times.

The core syntax is shown below; the example runs for two iterations and prints the value of i each time. The comparison operators are written -lt for "less than", -le for "less than or equal", -eq for "equal", -ne for "not equal", etc.

```
For ($i = 1; $i -lt 3; $i++)
{
    $i
}
```
#### **Parameters**

When you execute a script, you can pass arguments on the command line. You can provide names for each parameter to help the script extract the values. For example:

```
.\setupEnvironment.ps1 -size 5 -location "East US"
```

Inside the script, you'll capture the values into variables. In this example, the parameters are matched by name:

```
param([string]$location, [int]$size)
```

You can omit the names from the command line. For example:

```
.\setupEnvironment.ps1 5 "East US"
```

Inside the script, you'll rely on position for matching when the parameters are unnamed:
```
param([int]$size, [string]$location)
```
