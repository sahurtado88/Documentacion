# Ansible

Ansible is a suite of software tools that enables infrastructure as code. It is open-source and the suite includes software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment functionality

Ansible is agentless

## Playbooks

Ansible Playbooks offer a repeatable, re-usable, simple configuration management and multi-machine deployment system, one that is well suited to deploying complex applications. If you need to execute a task with Ansible more than once, write a playbook and put it under source control. Then you can use the playbook to push out new configuration or confirm the configuration of remote systems.

Play defines a set of activities (tasks (an action to be performed on the host like execute command, run a script, install package, etc)) to be run on hosts

- plays have name, hosts and tasks
- properties of dictionary the order doesn't matter
- a list or array is an order collection and order matter

```
-
    name: 'Update nameserver entry into resolv.conf file on localhost'
    hosts: localhost
    tasks:
        -
            name: 'Update nameserver entry into resolv.conf file'
            lineinfile:
                path: /etc/resolv.conf
                line: 'nameserver {{nameserver_ip}}'
```

```
-
    name: 'Update nameserver entry into resolv.conf file on localhost'
    hosts: localhost
    vars:
        car_model: 'BMWM3'
        country_name: 'USA'
        title: 'SystemsEngineer'
    tasks:
        -
            name: 'Print my car model'
            command: 'echo "My car''s model is {{car_model}}"'
        -
            name: 'Print my country'
            command: 'echo "I live in the {{country_name}}"'
        -
            name: 'Print my title'
            command: 'echo "I work as a {{title}}"'
```


## Conditionals

```
-
    name: 'Execute a script on all web server nodes'
    hosts: all_servers
    tasks:
        -
            service: 'name=mysql state=started'
            when: ansible_host =='server4.company.com'
```

```
-
    name: 'Am I an Adult or a Child?'
    hosts: localhost
    vars:
        age: 25
    tasks:
        -
            command: 'echo "I am a Child"'
            when: age<18
        -
            command: 'echo "I am an Adult"'
            when: age >= 18
```
```
-
    name: 'Add name server entry if not already entered'
    hosts: localhost
    tasks:
        -
            shell: 'cat /etc/resolv.conf'
            register: command_output
        -
            shell: 'echo "nameserver 10.0.250.10" >> /etc/resolv.conf'
            when: 'command_output.stdout.find("10.0.250.10") == -1'


```

## Loops

Ansible offers the **loop**, **with_\<lookup\>**, and **until** keywords to execute a task multiple times. Examples of commonly-used loops include changing ownership on several files and/or directories with the file module, creating multiple users with the user module, and repeating a polling step until a certain result is reached.
```
-
    name: 'Print list of fruits'
    hosts: localhost
    vars:
        fruits:
            - Apple
            - Banana
            - Grapes
            - Orange
    tasks:
        -
            command: 'echo "{{ item }}"'
            with_items: '{{ fruits }}'

```
```
-
    name: 'Install required packages'
    hosts: localhost
    vars:
        packages:
            - httpd
            - binutils
            - glibc
            - ksh
            - libaio
            - libXext
            - gcc
            - make
            - sysstat
            - unixODBC
            - mongodb
            - nodejs
            - grunt
    tasks:
        -
            yum: 'name={{ item }} state=present'
            with_items: "{{ packages}}"

```

## Ansible Roles

Roles let you automatically load related vars, files, tasks, handlers, and other Ansible artifacts based on a known file structure. After you group your content in roles, you can easily reuse them and share them with other users.

etc/ansible/roles is default location ansible search for roles

## Preparing windows

- Ansible control machine can only be a linux and not windows
- Windows machines can be targets of ansible and thus be part of automation
- Ansible connects to a windows machine using winrm
- Requirements
    - pywinrm module installed on the ansible control machine- pip install "pywinrm>=0.2.2"
    - setup WinRM- examples/scripts/configureRemotingFor Ansible.ps1
    - Diffetent modes of authentication:
        - Basic/Certificate/Kerberos/NTML/CredSSP

## Ansible Galaxy

Ansible Galaxy is essentially a large public repository of Ansible roles. Roles ship with READMEs detailing the role's use and available variables. Galaxy contains a large number of roles that are constantly evolving and increasing. Galaxy can use git to add other role sources, such as GitHub.

## Patterns

When you execute Ansible through an ad hoc command or by running a playbook, you must choose which managed nodes or groups you want to execute against. Patterns let you run commands and playbooks against specific hosts and/or groups in your inventory. An Ansible pattern can refer to a single host, an IP address, an inventory group, a set of groups, or all hosts in your inventory. Patterns are highly flexible - you can exclude or require subsets of hosts, use wildcards or regular expressions, and more. Ansible executes on all inventory hosts included in the pattern.

### Common patternsÔÉÅ
This table lists common patterns for targeting inventory hosts and groups.

Description|Pattern(s)|Targets
|-|-|-|
All hosts|all (or *)|
One host	|host1
Multiple hosts	|host1:host2 (or host1,host2)
One group	|webservers
Multiple groups	|webservers:dbservers|all hosts in webservers plus all hosts in dbservers
Excluding groups	|webservers:!atlanta|all hosts in webservers except those in atlanta
Intersection of groups	|webservers:&staging|any hosts in webservers that are also in staging

You can use either a comma (,) or a colon (:) to separate a list of hosts. The comma is preferred when dealing with ranges and IPv6 addresses.

## Dynamic inventory

If your Ansible inventory fluctuates over time, with hosts spinning up and shutting down in response to business demands, the static inventory solutions described in How to build your inventory will not serve your needs. You may need to track hosts from multiple sources: cloud providers, LDAP, Cobbler, and/or enterprise CMDB systems.

Ansible integrates all of these options through a dynamic external inventory system. Ansible supports two ways to connect with external inventory: Inventory plugins and inventory scripts.

Inventory plugins take advantage of the most recent updates to the Ansible core code. We recommend plugins over scripts for dynamic inventory. You can write your own plugin to connect to additional dynamic inventory sources.

You can still use inventory scripts if you choose. When we implemented inventory plugins, we ensured backwards compatibility through the script inventory plugin. The examples below illustrate how to use inventory scripts.

If you prefer a GUI for handling dynamic inventory, the inventory database on AWX or Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform syncs with all your dynamic inventory sources, provides web and REST access to the results, and offers a graphical inventory editor. With a database record of all of your hosts, you can correlate past event history and see which hosts have had failures on their last playbook runs

## Custom modules

A module is a reusable, standalone script that Ansible runs on your behalf, either locally or remotely. Modules interact with your local machine, an API, or a remote system to perform specific tasks like changing a database password or spinning up a cloud instance. Each module can be used by the Ansible API, or by the ansible or ansible-playbook programs. A module provides a defined interface, accepts arguments, and returns information to Ansible by printing a JSON string to stdout before exiting.
