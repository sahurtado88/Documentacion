"... it can respond to you with follow-up questions and statements ..."

resemble: To resemble something is to look or be like it. Mark's new home resembles his old apartment. Both have a minimalist theme.

"... there usually was some sort of interface that you had to use in between."

stalling: Stalling is delaying on purpose because you need more time, usually to think or to do something. Clarissa is an expert at stalling. She engages clients in small talk until her boss is ready to meet them.

"Siri is very clever about stalling."

kind of: This is an informal expression that means "somewhat" or "to some small degree." I'm kind of worried about my upcoming presentation. I know it's good, but I'm not sure if the clients will get it.

"... you're being kind of kept waiting."

Grammar tip: The question words "where" and "how"

Questions words are used when asking about different things.

We use the question word where to ask about location:

"Siri, where are you from?"

Meanwhile, we use how together with certain words to ask about quantity, manner, procedure and length:

"How far away is Jupiter?"

"How old are you?"

More examples:

Where have you been?
Where did you put the folder?
Where is Leanne? She's not in her work station.

How bad was the car accident?
How long will the job interview take?
How much money do we have?


"Either ... or ..." is often used to talk about a choice between two possibilities.

You can have either tea or coffee.

Sometimes more than two choices are given.

Would you like to add some syrup to your coffee? You can have either mint, hazelnut or caramel.

An "either ... or ..." sentence must have a balanced structure, so that the same kind of words or expressions follow "either" and "or."

He's either in London or in Rome.
(In this sentence, "in London" and "in Rome" are prepositional phrases.)

"Either ... or ..." is used to talk about two or more choices.

An "either ... or ..." sentence must have a balanced structure, so that the same kind of words or expressions follow "either" and "or."

You can ask about a person's job:

What do you do in Company A?

If the person has mentioned that he/she has children, then it's okay to ask how many children he/she has, and what the children's ages are.

How many children do you have?
How old are they?

You can talk about other light topics:

How was your flight?

How was the traffic?

Do you like the weather?

Really? How many months along are you?



Hello. You two look familiar. Have we met before?

spirit animal: a metaphor that refers to someone or something that a person can relate to or admire

Ryan jokes that his spirit animal is a sloth, because he just wants to sleep and eat all day.

"Phyllis Diller is my spirit animal, basically."

Grammar tip: Relative clauses that start with "which"

A relative clause is a dependent clause that begins with a relative pronoun, such as who, whose, where, when and which.

A relative clause that starts with which gives more information about the noun that precedes the clause.

"My piano, which I don't play anymore."

"The toaster is inside the cabinet, which I don't necessarily like, but I don't hate."

More examples:

For the camping trip, Alana let Brent borrow a tent, which can accommodate two people.
Brett has flexible working hours, which allows him to go to work later than other employees.
Nora has an excellent attendance record, which positively affects her chances of being promoted at work.

"If" and "whether" are words that imply uncertainty. They are often used interchangeably in informal speech and writing, but in formal communication, it is better to remember the rules for using the two words.

"If"and "whether" may be used interchangeably in relation to yes or no questions. If you are in a formal communication context, it is better to use "whether."

"If" should be used when talking about a condition.

"Whether" is used when two or more options exist.

"Whether or not" is used when two alternatives are possible, and the same action is done or should be done in either case.

Grammar tip: The zero and first conditional

Conditionals are sentences used to discuss hypothetical situations, and their effects or consequences. A conditional usually includes a conditional clause, also known as the if-clause.

The zero conditional is used when making statements about real or factual situations at the present time. It is formed by combining the condition (if + simple present tense), and the result (simple present tense.)

"But if birds know that there's a predator chasing them, they start to leave the area ..."

More examples:

If the temperature drops below zero, it snows.
Food spoils if it is in a hot place for several days.

The first conditional, also known as the "real conditional," is used when talking about possibilities and their results. The first conditional is formed by combining the condition (if + simple present tense), and the result (will + the zero infinitive).

"... even if the next generation comes through, they'll go, 'Well, I don't know why I don't want to go there ...'"

"If you can start to change where they nest ... the likelihood is they'll stay away as well ..."

More examples:

If Marty sees Jennifer tomorrow, he will tell her about the department's upcoming project.
The manager will sign the documents if it is delivered within the day.

# zero conditional


# first conditional
The first conditional describes what will happen if a condition is met.

If you prepare well, you will win the account.

The first conditional sentence is formed by combining a condition (simple present tense) + a result (simple future tense).

If you don’t lower the price, the client will reject the proposal.
Unless you lower the price, the client will reject the proposal.

The first conditional or "the real conditional" talks about real possibilities.

It is formed with a condition (simple present tense) + a result (simple future tense).


# second conditional

The second conditional is often called "the unreal conditional" because it is used for situations that are impossible or not likely to happen.

The second conditional describes an imaginary result for an unreal situation.

If I won the lottery, I would buy a big house.
If we had a billion dollars, we would set up a movie production company.

The second conditional sentence is formed by combining CONDITION ("if" clause using the simple past tense) + RESULT (main clause using "would" + main verb).

If I were rich, I would quit my job.

We can contract "would" into "'d," and "would not" into "wouldn't":

I'd lower taxes if I were* the president.
He wouldn't lower taxes if he were* the president. 

*Although some people use "was" in second conditional statements, the more correct verb to use for both singular and plural nouns/pronouns in the second conditional is "were."

The second conditional is used for situations that are impossible or not likely to happen.

The second conditional is formed by combining the CONDITION ("if" clause using the simple past tense ) + RESULT (main clause using "would" + main verb).

# third conditional

The third conditional is often called "the past conditional" because it concerns only past situations.

It is used to talk about a past result that can no longer exist because the chance for its condition to be fulfilled has passed. There is always an unspoken "but ..." phrase.

If Greg had saved more money, he would have bought a bigger car.
(... but Greg did not save more money.)

You would have met the deadline if you had worked harder.
(... but you did not work harder.)

The third conditional sentence is formed by combining CONDITION ("if" + past perfect) +  RESULT (the main clause using "would" + "have" + past participle).

If we had arrived earlier, we would have been able to buy tickets.
If their goalkeeper had not been so good, we would have won the game.

An alternative form to "If ... had/had not ..." is "Had … would have …".

Had Greg saved more money, he would have bought a bigger car.
Had you worked harder, you would have met the deadline.

The third conditional is used to talk about a past result that is no longer possible. It follows the format:

CONDITION ("If" + past perfect) + RESULT ("... would have …" + past participle)

If you had arrived earlier, you would have seen the presentation.
If we had waited longer, we would have been caught in the rain.


# conditional mixt

# Conditionals using could

The use of "could" changes the level of certainty expressed in a conditional sentence.

In the second conditional, replace "would" with "could" to express less certainty about a hypothetical future result.

If I learned another language, I would get a better job. (certain)
If I learned another language, I could get a better job. (less certain)

In the third conditional, replace "would" with "could" to express less certainty about a hypothetical past result.

You would have gotten the job if you had gone to the interview. (certain)
You could have gotten the job if you had gone to the interview. (less certain)

Verbs followed by gerunds and infinitives

For some verbs such as "like," "love" and "hate," it makes no difference if they are followed by a gerund or an infinitive. The meaning of the sentence does not change: "I like swimming" (gerund) and "I like to swim" mean the same thing.

- "Stop" + gerund means to stop an activity completely.

Jack stopped smoking when he turned 40.
Philip and Rachel stopped buying soda because they wanted to limit their sugar intake.

- "Stop" + infinitive means to stop another activity in order to do the action stated in the infinitive phrase.

I worked the whole morning, but I stopped to smoke for 15 minutes.
We drove for two hours then stopped to buy some soda.

-"Go on" + gerund means to continue what one is already doing.

When I am interrupted by phone calls, it's difficult for me to go on working.

- "Go on" + infinitive means to move on to a different action that is related to the first one.

When you write an email, keep the introduction short and go on to state the purpose of your email immediately.
After the speaker gave her presentation, she went on to ask the audience for comments. 

- "Try" + gerund means to test out an option.

Have you tried restarting your computer?
If the customer can't be reached by phone, try sending him an email.

- "Try" + infinitive means to make an effort or to attempt.

I have tried to access my email several times already, but the system just won't work.

_________________

Restrictive clauses provide information about a noun.

Restrictive clauses give information that you need in order to understand the sentence correctly. They are not enclosed by commas.

The player who has the number 10 printed on his shirt is the team captain.

If you take the restrictive clause away, the sentence loses very important information. You can no longer distinguish who among the players is the team captain.

The player is the team captain.

Nonrestrictive clauses also provide information about a noun.

Unlike restrictive clauses, nonrestrictive clauses give extra information. They are always written between commas.

Player number 10, who is the team captain, will take the trophy home.

If you leave out the nonrestrictive clause between the commas, the sentence still gives the same basic information.

Player number 10 will take the trophy home.

Grammar tip: Present vs past participles

Participles are words that look like verbs but are used as adjectives or adverbs.

Present participles describe the state of an object, or show what an object is used for. They can also be used to change the tense of a verb. Present participles end with the suffix -ing.

"... and it carried an interesting payload: a dummy astronaut riding a Tesla car that was orbiting space."

Past participles are used to describe an action that was done to an object or person. Most past participles end in -ed, -en, -d, -t, or -n.

"The company is valued at over $50 billion."

Rica was treasured by her teammates because of her hard work and dedication to her job.

________________________

party: a person or group that is taking part in a discussion or negotiation

After several hours of talk and compromise, each party in the meeting was able to get what he or she wanted.

"In some cultures, it's appropriate [...] to tell the other party he's wrong."

irreconcilable: describing a situation or event that is impossible to fix, resolve or deal with

The partnership between the two firms was unsuccessful because there were irreconcilable differences between the companies' desired goals.

"In other cultures, the same behavior would provoke anger and possibly an irreconcilable breakdown of the relationship."

verbal cues: specific signals given during speech, such as choice of words or tone of voice, that can mean certain things

The manager's verbal cues, such as his low tone and his short responses, showed that he was disappointed with the team's presentation.

"The key is to listen for verbal cues ..."

counterpart: someone who has the same tasks as another person, but in another system, location or company

Daniel is a marketing specialist for Sunlight Inc. in the U.S.; he often has discussions about global marketing solutions with Michelle, his counterpart in Sunlight Inc., France.

"If your German counterpart says he completely disagrees, you may be on the verge of a highly enjoyable debate."

on the verge of (something): close to achieving something; close to making or seeing something happen

Three months after starting the video project, the team was on the verge of having a final product to show clients.

"... you may be on the verge of a highly enjoyable debate."

brewing: beginning to form or develop

Hannah knew that problems were brewing in her company after she heard managers discuss reductions in budget.

"If a Peruvian you're negotiating with says he disagrees a little, it might actually mean that a serious problem is brewing."

unfiltered: without moderating or softening something in tone, such as an opinion

Being direct and unfiltered is helpful when negotiating with people from some cultures -- if something cannot be done, it may be better to say, "It is impossible!"

"But to a very direct and unfiltered culture like the Dutch, these understatements lead to massive miscommunication."

knee-jerk response: an answer given automatically or based on habit, rather than after consideration

When Gina heard an opinion that she believed to be incorrect, her knee-jerk response was to disagree before hearing the entire argument.

"In other cultures, 'no' is the most frequent knee-jerk response ..."

body language: physical movements or facial expressions, that can show a person's true feelings

To help give better presentations, Regina makes sure to display confident body language: she stands straight, makes eye contact, and uses minimal hand movements.

"... By [...] paying attention to tone and body language, you can usually tell when a 'yes' feels more like a 'no' ..."

Grammar tip: The causative "get"

Causatives are verbs that express the idea that a person is doing something for someone else. In a sentence with a causative, the subject causes an action to happen, but the subject does not perform the action himself or herself. Some examples of causatives are get, let, make, have and help.

Get can be used to talk about achieving a certain objective or state, or ensuring that an action is done. The following formula can be used: get + person + to + infinitive.

"Managers are constantly learning that what gets you to [say] 'yes' in one culture gets you to [say] 'no' in another."

More examples:

Anna usually gets suppliers to reduce prices for her company.
Mark, a software salesman, aims to get the clients to upgrade their programs.
The manager will get the department head to review the proposal by this afternoon.

Another formula that can be used is get + object + past participle. In this case, the doer of the action is not mentioned, so the action is emphasized.

Melie got her car fixed yesterday.
Franco will get the garden's grass cut before 7:00 p.m.
The writer gets her feature articles published every month.
