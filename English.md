stilted: This refers to something that appears unnatural and funny from being too formal. The talk show host spoke very well, but his guest spoke in a stilted way.

"... you always had to speak to it in a very, kind of, stilted language ..."

follow-up: This refers to something that continues a process that has already begun. Jane sent a follow-up email to say that she wouldn't be able to attend the meeting after all.

"... it can respond to you with follow-up questions and statements ..."

resemble: To resemble something is to look or be like it. Mark's new home resembles his old apartment. Both have a minimalist theme.

"... questions that begin to resemble a real conversation ..."

interface: This refers to the hardware and software that let a person use a computer. The thing I like best about this phone is its touch-screen interface.

"... there usually was some sort of interface that you had to use in between."

stalling: Stalling is delaying on purpose because you need more time, usually to think or to do something. Clarissa is an expert at stalling. She engages clients in small talk until her boss is ready to meet them.

"Siri is very clever about stalling."

kind of: This is an informal expression that means "somewhat" or "to some small degree." I'm kind of worried about my upcoming presentation. I know it's good, but I'm not sure if the clients will get it.

"... you're being kind of kept waiting."

Grammar tip: The question words "where" and "how"

Questions words are used when asking about different things.

We use the question word where to ask about location:

"Siri, where are you from?"

Meanwhile, we use how together with certain words to ask about quantity, manner, procedure and length:

"How far away is Jupiter?"

"How old are you?"

More examples:

Where have you been?
Where did you put the folder?
Where is Leanne? She's not in her work station.

How bad was the car accident?
How long will the job interview take?
How much money do we have?


"Either ... or ..." is often used to talk about a choice between two possibilities.

You can have either tea or coffee.

Sometimes more than two choices are given.

Would you like to add some syrup to your coffee? You can have either mint, hazelnut or caramel.

An "either ... or ..." sentence must have a balanced structure, so that the same kind of words or expressions follow "either" and "or."

He's either in London or in Rome.
(In this sentence, "in London" and "in Rome" are prepositional phrases.)

"Either ... or ..." is used to talk about two or more choices.

An "either ... or ..." sentence must have a balanced structure, so that the same kind of words or expressions follow "either" and "or."

You can ask about a person's job:

What do you do in Company A?

If the person has mentioned that he/she has children, then it's okay to ask how many children he/she has, and what the children's ages are.

How many children do you have?
How old are they?

You can talk about other light topics:

How was your flight?

How was the traffic?

Do you like the weather?

Really? How many months along are you?



Hello. You two look familiar. Have we met before?

spirit animal: a metaphor that refers to someone or something that a person can relate to or admire

Ryan jokes that his spirit animal is a sloth, because he just wants to sleep and eat all day.

"Phyllis Diller is my spirit animal, basically."

Grammar tip: Relative clauses that start with "which"

A relative clause is a dependent clause that begins with a relative pronoun, such as who, whose, where, when and which.

A relative clause that starts with which gives more information about the noun that precedes the clause.

"My piano, which I don't play anymore."

"The toaster is inside the cabinet, which I don't necessarily like, but I don't hate."

More examples:

For the camping trip, Alana let Brent borrow a tent, which can accommodate two people.
Brett has flexible working hours, which allows him to go to work later than other employees.
Nora has an excellent attendance record, which positively affects her chances of being promoted at work.

past actions
yesterday
recently
 
actions being performed at present
currently
now
 
future actions/actions that come after other actions
eventually
soon
In a sentence, adverbs of time can be placed:

at the beginning or at the end of the independent clause;
before the verb, after the linking verb, or between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.

"Whether or not" is used when two alternatives are possible, and the same action is done or should be done in either case.

OR
Inform the team whether you're going to be late or not.
(If you're going to be late, inform the team. If you're not going to be late, inform the team. Informing the team is important in both cases.)

"If" and "whether" are words that imply uncertainty. They are often used interchangeably in informal speech and writing, but in formal communication, it is better to remember the rules for using the two words.

"If"and "whether" may be used interchangeably in relation to yes or no questions. If you are in a formal communication context, it is better to use "whether."

"If" should be used when talking about a condition.

"Whether" is used when two or more options exist.

"Whether or not" is used when two alternatives are possible, and the same action is done or should be done in either case.
