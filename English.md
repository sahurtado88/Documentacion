"... you always had to speak to it in a very, kind of, stilted language ..."

"... you're being kind of kept waiting."

Grammar tip: The question words "where" and "how"

Questions words are used when asking about different things.

We use the question word where to ask about location:

"Siri, where are you from?"

Meanwhile, we use how together with certain words to ask about quantity, manner, procedure and length:

"How far away is Jupiter?"

"How old are you?"

More examples:

Where have you been?
Where did you put the folder?
Where is Leanne? She's not in her work station.

How bad was the car accident?
How long will the job interview take?
How much money do we have?


"Either ... or ..." is often used to talk about a choice between two possibilities.

You can have either tea or coffee.

Sometimes more than two choices are given.

Would you like to add some syrup to your coffee? You can have either mint, hazelnut or caramel.

An "either ... or ..." sentence must have a balanced structure, so that the same kind of words or expressions follow "either" and "or."

He's either in London or in Rome.
(In this sentence, "in London" and "in Rome" are prepositional phrases.)

"Either ... or ..." is used to talk about two or more choices.

An "either ... or ..." sentence must have a balanced structure, so that the same kind of words or expressions follow "either" and "or."

You can ask about a person's job:

What do you do in Company A?

If the person has mentioned that he/she has children, then it's okay to ask how many children he/she has, and what the children's ages are.

How many children do you have?
How old are they?

You can talk about other light topics:

How was your flight?

How was the traffic?

Do you like the weather?

Really? How many months along are you?



Hello. You two look familiar. Have we met before?

spirit animal: a metaphor that refers to someone or something that a person can relate to or admire

Ryan jokes that his spirit animal is a sloth, because he just wants to sleep and eat all day.

"Phyllis Diller is my spirit animal, basically."

Grammar tip: Relative clauses that start with "which"

A relative clause is a dependent clause that begins with a relative pronoun, such as who, whose, where, when and which.

A relative clause that starts with which gives more information about the noun that precedes the clause.

"My piano, which I don't play anymore."

"The toaster is inside the cabinet, which I don't necessarily like, but I don't hate."

More examples:

For the camping trip, Alana let Brent borrow a tent, which can accommodate two people.
Brett has flexible working hours, which allows him to go to work later than other employees.

"If" and "whether" are words that imply uncertainty. They are often used interchangeably in informal speech and writing, but in formal communication, it is better to remember the rules for using the two words.

"If"and "whether" may be used interchangeably in relation to yes or no questions. If you are in a formal communication context, it is better to use "whether."

"If" should be used when talking about a condition.

"Whether" is used when two or more options exist.

"Whether or not" is used when two alternatives are possible, and the same action is done or should be done in either case.

Grammar tip: The zero and first conditional

Conditionals are sentences used to discuss hypothetical situations, and their effects or consequences. A conditional usually includes a conditional clause, also known as the if-clause.

The zero conditional is used when making statements about real or factual situations at the present time. It is formed by combining the condition (if + simple present tense), and the result (simple present tense.)

"But if birds know that there's a predator chasing them, they start to leave the area ..."

More examples:

If the temperature drops below zero, it snows.
Food spoils if it is in a hot place for several days.

The first conditional, also known as the "real conditional," is used when talking about possibilities and their results. The first conditional is formed by combining the condition (if + simple present tense), and the result (will + the zero infinitive).

"... even if the next generation comes through, they'll go, 'Well, I don't know why I don't want to go there ...'"

"If you can start to change where they nest ... the likelihood is they'll stay away as well ..."

More examples:

If Marty sees Jennifer tomorrow, he will tell her about the department's upcoming project.
The manager will sign the documents if it is delivered within the day.

flaps

located at the trailing edge or back edge of a wing, in between the aileron and the body or fuselage of a plane. They are used to change the wing shape to increase lift or drag during takeoff and landing.


slats

located at the leading or front edge of the wings. They are used to increase the lift needed when an aircraft is maneuvering or landing.

trim tabs

plates connected to primary control surfaces such as ailerons, rudders and elevators. They are used to balance or increase the force a control surface is creating.


spoilers

# zero conditional


# first conditional
The first conditional describes what will happen if a condition is met.

If you prepare well, you will win the account.

The first conditional sentence is formed by combining a condition (simple present tense) + a result (simple future tense).

If you don’t lower the price, the client will reject the proposal.
Unless you lower the price, the client will reject the proposal.

The first conditional or "the real conditional" talks about real possibilities.

It is formed with a condition (simple present tense) + a result (simple future tense).


# second conditional

The second conditional is often called "the unreal conditional" because it is used for situations that are impossible or not likely to happen.

The second conditional describes an imaginary result for an unreal situation.

If I won the lottery, I would buy a big house.
If we had a billion dollars, we would set up a movie production company.

The second conditional sentence is formed by combining CONDITION ("if" clause using the simple past tense) + RESULT (main clause using "would" + main verb).

If I were rich, I would quit my job.

We can contract "would" into "'d," and "would not" into "wouldn't":

I'd lower taxes if I were* the president.
He wouldn't lower taxes if he were* the president. 

*Although some people use "was" in second conditional statements, the more correct verb to use for both singular and plural nouns/pronouns in the second conditional is "were."

The second conditional is used for situations that are impossible or not likely to happen.

The second conditional is formed by combining the CONDITION ("if" clause using the simple past tense ) + RESULT (main clause using "would" + main verb).

# third conditional

The third conditional is often called "the past conditional" because it concerns only past situations.

It is used to talk about a past result that can no longer exist because the chance for its condition to be fulfilled has passed. There is always an unspoken "but ..." phrase.

If Greg had saved more money, he would have bought a bigger car.
(... but Greg did not save more money.)

You would have met the deadline if you had worked harder.
(... but you did not work harder.)

The third conditional sentence is formed by combining CONDITION ("if" + past perfect) +  RESULT (the main clause using "would" + "have" + past participle).

If we had arrived earlier, we would have been able to buy tickets.
If their goalkeeper had not been so good, we would have won the game.

An alternative form to "If ... had/had not ..." is "Had … would have …".

Had Greg saved more money, he would have bought a bigger car.
Had you worked harder, you would have met the deadline.

The third conditional is used to talk about a past result that is no longer possible. It follows the format:

CONDITION ("If" + past perfect) + RESULT ("... would have …" + past participle)

If you had arrived earlier, you would have seen the presentation.
If we had waited longer, we would have been caught in the rain.
